#POSTMAN
-just like Chrome or Safari or Edge, POSTMANT is an app browser.
-POSTMAN is an in app browser that allows you to test your API routes.
-You can send any request you want to in POSTMAN, can't do the same in a browser.
-In a browser client, you can only send GET requests. When you type in a URL and hit enter, that is always a GET request.
-To get an index route, you should send a GET request to, http://localhost:3000/sandwhiches
the following json should be available through this GET request route:

-The request body holds whatever information is being sent with the request.

A Request has 3 parts to it:

1. Method of what the request is: GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE
2. Headers: any information about the request, like content type = application json.
3. BODY: the information you are sending about the request.

-If you are saying you sent application JSON data in the header, than
you actually need to send that in the body of the request.

PATCH: http://localhost:3000/sandwiches/3

-the request body holds whatever information is being sent about the request.
-eventually be someones user input that we send as the request body,
-In POSTMAN, you skip the user input part and you just have a body, that we will pass raw JSON.

-   JSON the keys need to be strings.
